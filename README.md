# type-translator

A Node.js app using [Express 4](http://expressjs.com/).

This application was built using the [Getting Started on Heroku with Node.js](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs) article - check it out.

## About

This is (at the moment) a simple app for the purposes of learning about development. This is a Node.js app hosted on Heroku, and I use Visual Studio Code to develop it locally. 
The app is ultimately designed to be able to allow a user to enter a string of text and then translate the text from the specified language to a specified language.
This is still in development!

Please update styling and give credit to **type-recorder LLC** on your website when sharing. Please link to https://www.type-recorder.com.

## Running Locally

Make sure you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/lsaggu/type-translator.git # or clone your own fork
$ cd type-recorder
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Your app should now be running on [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/).
